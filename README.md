PLC and SCADA System Design for Pollution Control in Rawalpindi 
I developed a PLC and SCADA system for pollution control in Rawalpindi, integrating sensors, communication protocols, and budgeting considerations. This project aimed to monitor and manage environmental parameters to reduce pollution levels effectively.

System Components and Design:

Sensors Integration: Integrated various sensors (such as air quality sensors, particulate matter sensors, and weather sensors) to continuously monitor pollution levels in key areas of Rawalpindi.

PLC Programming: Utilized PLCs to control and automate devices such as pollution control equipment (like air purifiers or emission control systems) based on sensor readings and predefined control algorithms.

SCADA System Implementation: Designed and implemented a SCADA system to provide a centralized monitoring and control interface. This allowed operators to visualize real-time data from sensors, monitor pollution levels, and remotely control devices.

Communication Protocols: Implemented communication protocols (such as Modbus or Ethernet/IP) to ensure seamless data transmission between PLCs, sensors, and the SCADA system.

Budgeting and Cost Considerations: Considered budget constraints during system design, optimizing the selection of sensors, PLCs, SCADA software, and communication infrastructure to achieve cost-effective pollution control solutions.
